Most of my photos are available for licensing for online and print use.

Please contact mike@mikestimpson.com and we'll sort something out.

If you want to use my photos in an educational or non-commercial setting then that's fine. I would ask that you credit me and, if possible, link back to this website.

If you're not sure whether your use qualifies as non-commercial then just throw me an email.
